# simple-_blockhain_implementation
In this application we have developed a blockchain application with basic blockchain functions
there is a blockchain that is centralized in this scenario, and when the center node starts to work, it creates the genesis block. 
After that, it starts to listen in 3000 ports to respond to incoming requests.
When the miner starts to work, the central node sends a request to join the network.
